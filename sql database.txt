This schema includes the necessary tables and relationships to fulfill the requirements you mentioned. Here's a breakdown of the tables:

    The "Movie" table stores information about each movie, such as its title, release year, duration, and rating.
    The "Media" table allows a movie to have multiple media (videos or images) associated with it. Each media entry has a media_id and a reference to the movie it belongs to (movie_id).
    The "Genre" table holds the different genres of movies.
    The "Movie_Genre" table establishes a many-to-many relationship between movies and genres. It links movies and genres through their respective IDs.
    The "User" table stores user information, including a unique user_id, username, and password.
    The "Review" table represents reviews given by users for movies. It contains a review_id, a reference to the movie being reviewed (movie_id), a reference to the user who wrote the review (user_id), the review text, and a rating.
    The "Artist" table stores information about artists involved in movies, with an artist_id and the artist's name.
    The "Skill" table contains different skills an artist can have.
    The "Artist_Skill" table establishes a many-to-many relationship between artists and skills. It links artists and skills through their respective IDs.
    The "Movie_Artist" table represents the roles artists play in movies. It connects movies and artists through their respective IDs and includes a role_name field to specify the role.

This schema provides the necessary structure to represent movies, media, genres, reviews, users, artists, skills, and their relationships in the IMDB database.
